# 5.0.0

feat: improve UTF string handling and `size_t` compatibility

* Enhance UTF string conversion and buffer handling
  - Improve buffer conversion efficiency by batching character adds
  - Add `mulle_utf8data` introspection capabilities
  - Optimize UTF32 to UTF8 conversion paths

* Strengthen type safety and consistency
  - Replace unsigned int with `size_t` for string lengths
  - Change `mulle_utf8_t` to char for better C compatibility
  - Update function signatures to use `size_t` consistently

* Breaking changes
  - Rename `mulle_unicode_is_privatecharacterplane` to `mulle_utf_is_privatecharacterplane`
  - Change parameter order in `_strcnpy` functions
  - Update `mulle_utf_add_bytes_function_t` typedef
  - Move stdlib-like code to mulle-utf8-string.c

* Other improvements
  - Increase test coverage significantly
  - Fix 32-bit compatibility issues
  - Update CMake configuration for better Windows support


# 4.0.0

* upped the test coverage significantly
* **BREAKING CHANGE** the `mulle_utf_add_bytes_function_t` typedef is no longer a function pointer, to keep it more inline with other library callback typedefs
* **BREAKING CHANGE** changed the parameter order of `_strcnpy` functions, because progress demands it
* **BREAKING CHANGE** renamed `mulle_unicode_is_privatecharacterplane` to `mulle_utf_is_privatecharacterplane` (but MulleObjCUnicodeFoundation resupplies it as a static inline function)
* **BREAKING CHANGE** uses now ``size_t`` for char (byte) lengths and unsigned int for anything else
* `mulle_utf8_t` is no more, it is now just char
* improve `mulle_utf32_as_utf8` conversion, add some `mulle_utf8data` introspection
* improve buffer conversion by not calling addbytes for each character

### 1.0.11

* modernize project

1.0.9
===

* improve documentation
* fix homebrew formula generation

1.0.7
===

* improve documentation
* consistent errno return value for bufferconvert


1.0.5
===

* improve documentation
* reintroduce bom16 functions

1.0.3
===

* add travis.yml

1.0.1
===

* changed the char5 characterset to match typical Objective-C identifiers
better. Need to update the compiler too.
* redid the API to be more consistent with other projects

0.5.1
===

* improve the documentation somewhat

0.5
===

* incorporated some code from `mulle_regex`, namely those `_string` functions.
* add dependency to `mulle_allocator` for convenience methods
* changed parameter order in bytebuffer conversion functions!
* allow len to be passed as -1 to `mulle_utf<>_information` for convenience.


0.4
===

* Unify all utf8/16/32_info structs into one `mulle_utf_information`.
* added mulle_utf_is_validurlscheme.h


0.3
===

* add routines to iterate over utf8/utf16/utf32 forwards and (!) backwards
* fixed some bugs with respect to surrogate asserts in utf32


0.2
===

* removed BOM check from most routines. It is now expected that you strip
  the BOM away yourself
* added mulle_char5 encoding
* surrogate pairs are considered non-characters in utf32 encoding


0.1
===

* started versioning

* changed the callback scheme to a uniform `add`. This is nice,
  because by default the utf routines will use host order. If you want
  to have flipped output just change the `add`routine.

* renamed mulle_utf8char_t and friends to mulle_utf8_t
